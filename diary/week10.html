<b><p>What is your project about?</b><br>
Strawberries.
</p>

<b><p>What is the data you plan to use?</b><br>
    •	https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/All/year/2022/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/081010# <br>
    •	https://www-statista-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/statistics/951046/japan-strawberry-production-volume/?locale=en <br>
    •	https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/SGP/year/2021/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/product/081010 <br>
    
    These data sources provide insights on the production, imports, exports and consumption of strawberries.   
</p>

<b><p>What is the question you plan to answer?</b><br>
    How are the consumption, production, imports, and exports of strawberries in the world?
</p>

<b><p>Why is this an important question?</b><br>
    From this we are able to track the effect that Singapore would have as we are starting to produce our own local-grown strawberries.
</p>

<b><p>Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question?</b><br>
I plan to use countries and years as the headers with import volume and production volume as the data points.
</p>

<p>This week challenges I faced was just getting started with the project. The idea I envision feels overwhelming.
