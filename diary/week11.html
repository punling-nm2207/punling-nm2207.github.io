    <p>Overall the datasets I am touching on are quite clean and straightforward, I also plan to use them in a bar, line and bubble chart.
    However I am facing errors with the charts showing up on my webpage and I have been spending multiple hours trying to find out what
    went wrong. Unfortunately, I am still unable to fix it so I will continue working on them next week. I also tried to make my story data
    fit a bigger picture.</p>
