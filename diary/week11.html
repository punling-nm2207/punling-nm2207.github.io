<body>
    Describe the data of your project and the visualizations you plan to use. Attribute anything you plan to use from
    somewhere else. Report the errors and challenges you are facing.<br>

    Overall the datasets I am touching on are quite clean and straightforward, I also plan to use them in a bar, line and bubble chart.
    However I am facing errors with the charts showing up on my webpage and I have been spending multiple hours trying to find out what
    went wrong. Unfortunately, I am still unable to fix it so I will continue working on them next week. I also tried to make my story data
    fit a bigger picture.
