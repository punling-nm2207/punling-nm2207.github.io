            <h1><b>WHAT IS STRAWBERRY SEASON? üçì üçì üçì </b></h1>
            <p>It's a delightful time of year when the fields are filled with luscious heart-shaped strawberries that
                are irresistible due to their sweet and juicy flavor. The sweet scent of strawberries fills the air and
                the sight of the bright red fruit peeking out from under the leaves is simply delightful. It's a time
                when you can't help but feel a little giddy with excitement, knowing that you're about to indulge in
                some of the freshest and most delicious strawberries available!</p>

            <p>The strawberry season varies depending on the country and region. In cooler climates, such as the
                northern hemisphere, the peak strawberry season typically occurs in late spring and early summer. This
                is because strawberries require cool weather to grow, while also needing enough sunlight to ripen.
                During this time, farmers and growers work diligently to ensure that their strawberries are harvested at
                the perfect time by carefully monitoring weather, soil moisture, and the ripeness of the fruit. Once
                harvested, the strawberries are packed and transported to local markets and grocery stores where
                consumers eagerly await their arrival.</p>

    <div id="myDIV2">
        <h1><b>SINGAPORE, STRAWBERRIES AND THE GLOBAL SCALE</b></h1>
        <p>Singapore relies heavily on imported food, including strawberries, which are sourced from various countries.
            If
            there is a supply chain disruption or shortage of strawberries in one country, Singapore can usually find
            alternative sources of supply to meet the demand for the fruit. However, various factors can affect the
            availability and prices of strawberries in Singapore, including supply
            and demand, weather conditions, and trade policies. Like any other country, the cost and availability of
            strawberries in Singapore can be influenced by global and regional market forces. </p>

        <p>For example, seasonal variations in supply and demand can impact the availability and prices of strawberries
            in
            Singapore. As strawberries are a seasonal crop, their availability and prices can vary depending on the time
            of
            year and the country of origin. During winter months, when strawberry production is limited in some
            countries,
            the demand for imported strawberries in Singapore may increase, leading to higher prices or shortages of the
            fruit. Conversely, during peak strawberry season in countries like Australia, when there is an oversupply of
            the
            fruit, the prices of imported strawberries in Singapore may decrease.</p>

        <p>Additionally, trade policies, such as import tariffs or restrictions on certain fruits, can affect the cost
            and
            availability of strawberries in Singapore. If a major supplier of strawberries to Singapore imposes an
            import
            tariff on the fruit, the prices of imported strawberries in Singapore may increase, making them less
            affordable
            for consumers. Similarly, if a country imposes restrictions on the import of strawberries due to safety or
            phytosanitary concerns, the availability of strawberries in Singapore may decrease.</p>

        <p>A real-life example of how market forces can affect the availability and prices of strawberries in Singapore
            is
            the shortage of strawberries in December 2020. This was due to a combination of factors, including seasonal
            weather conditions, increased demand in other markets, and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19
            pandemic. As a result, the prices of strawberries in Singapore increased significantly, and consumers
            reported
            difficulties in finding fresh strawberries in supermarkets and online grocery platforms. To address the
            shortage, retailers in Singapore turned to alternative sources of strawberries, including
            countries like Australia and the United States, which were experiencing a peak in their strawberry season.
            However, the higher cost of importing from these countries led to higher prices for consumers. The shortage
            of
            strawberries in Singapore also highlighted the country's dependence on imported food and the vulnerability
            of
            its food supply chain to global market forces.</p>

        <p>Finding out the strawberry imports to Singapore can reveal the countries from which Singapore sources its
            strawberries and the quantities imported from each country. This information can provide insights into the
            supply

        <h1><b>SO WHAT IS SINGAPORE DOING?</b></h1>
        <p>Singapore is not known for producing its own strawberries due to its tropical climate and limited land
            availability.
            However, the city-state is actively promoting sustainable agriculture and food security through various
            initiatives,
            including vertical farming, aquaponics, and rooftop gardening. These methods enable the cultivation of
            vegetables
            and herbs in urban areas, reducing Singapore's reliance on imported food. Its efforts in promoting
            sustainable
            agriculture and food security are significant steps towards achieving a more self-sufficient and sustainable
            food
            system.</p>

        <p>Strawberries grown in a vertical farm in Singapore have made their debut, marking a milestone in the
            country's
            efforts to promote local food production. The strawberries are grown in a high-tech, indoor vertical farm
            using
            hydroponic technology, which allows plants to grow without soil. The farm, run by a local company called
            Sustenir
            Agriculture, is capable of producing up to 150kg of strawberries per month. The initiative is part of
            Singapore's
            larger push to promote sustainable agriculture and food security through innovative and technology-driven
            methods of
            food production. (source:
