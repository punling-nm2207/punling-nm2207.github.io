        <h1>Hi!! My name is Ling and I love Strawberries!</h1>
        <p>Strawberries have always been known as a world-wide popular fruit and is eaten in many different forms all
            over the world. In Singapore, it is no different.</p>
        
        <p>Recently, Singapore has put in effort to grow our own strawberries in vertical farms. But is that enough
            to provide for our growing population? And what are the possible impacts of growing our own strawberries?</p>
        
        <p>I set to find out where our strawberries are coming from and how consumption of strawberries affects
            the economy of the world.
